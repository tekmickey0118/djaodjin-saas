    The queryset can be further filtered to a range of dates between
    ``start_at`` and ``ends_at``.

    The queryset can be further filtered by passing a ``q`` parameter.
    The value in ``q`` will be matched against:

      - User.first_name
      - User.last_name

    The result queryset can be ordered by:
